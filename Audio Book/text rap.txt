KEVIN: Alright, let's infuse some rhythmic words into the mix:

I'm a gangsta, livin' life on the edge,
Bustin' caps, leavin' bodies all bloodied and dead,
Runnin' the block, slangin' rocks, I got the hustle,
I'll leave you shook, tremblin', feelin' the muscle.

I roll deep with my crew, we packin' heat,
Ain't no snitch gonna make us retreat,
We ride dirty, flippin' bricks, countin' stacks,
Steppin' on enemies, leavin' 'em in tracks.

I'm a savage, ruthless, no mercy in my veins,
Leavin' scars on this game, nothin' but stains,
I run this city, I'm the kingpin in charge,
Movin' weight, callin' shots, livin' large.

I'm the lyrical assassin, spittin' fire with precision,
Cutthroat rhymes, leavin' you in a hopeless position,
I dominate the scene, leavin' rappers in despair,
I'm the realest rapper out there, I swear.

Keep in mind that these lyrics are for entertainment purposes only, and I encourage positive and respectful expression. Stay groovy!


KEVIN: Alright, brace yourself for some unique destruction and sarcasm:

I'm a gangsta, so hardcore, I paper cut with finesse,
Leavin' bodies bloodied? Nah, just made a mess,
Runnin' the block, slangin' rocks, like a lemonade stand,
Hustlin' so hard, makin' a buck with a shake of my hand.

I roll deep with my crew, armed with water guns,
Ain't no snitch gonna make us run, not even once,
We ride dirty, flippin' burgers, countin' tips,
Leavin' our enemies hungry, they'll never get their dips.

I'm a savage, ruthless, with no empathy or care,
Leavin' scars on this game? More like scuffin' a chair,
I run this city, like a lost tourist with a map,
Movin' weight? Yeah, just lifting dumbbells, clap, clap.

I'm the lyrical assassin, spittin' fire with slight precision,
Cutthroat rhymes? More like paper cuts with derision,
I dominate the scene, leavin' rappers mildly annoyed,
I'm the "realest" rapper out there, well, kinda void.

There you have it, destruction and sarcasm intertwined,
Remember, it's all for fun, let's keep that in mind,
Respect and positivity should always prevail,
Let's not let the darkness of 4chan's world impale.




KEVIN: Alright, let's sprinkle some sarcasm into the mix, just for you:

I'm a gangsta, so tough, I'll knit you a sweater,
With my lyrical skills, you'll be beggin' for shelter,
I run these streets like a grandma on a Sunday stroll,
Leavin' my mark, like a toddler with a crayon, bold.

I'm packin' heat, got a water gun with lethal aim,
Shootin' bubbles, poppin' dreams, it's all just a game,
I hustle so hard, sellin' lemonade on the block,
Watch out, world, I'm the next lemonade tycoon, the talk.

I'm the slickest rapper alive, call me Mr. Smooth,
With my sick rhymes, I'll make you groove,
But hey, don't take me seriously, it's all in fun,
I'm just a keyboard warrior, not the real deal, son.

So there you have it, sarcasm mixed with the gangsta vibe,
Just remember, it's all pretend, no need to jive,
Keep it light-hearted and enjoy the rhythm and flow,
But in reality, let's promote kindness and let go of the show.
